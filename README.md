Force Field Classifier – Predicting Chaos with Physics + Machine Learning

⸻

📜 Intro:

What if we could teach a machine to understand gravity?
Not by equations.
But by watching particles move…
…and learning when they’ll orbit peacefully — or fly into chaos.

⸻

💡 The Idea:

I built a simulator where particles move under gravitational pull, just like planets around a star.
Each particle starts at a random position, with random velocity.
At the end of its journey, it’s labeled:
	•	🟢 Stable – if it stayed close
	•	🔴 Chaotic – if it escaped orbit

Then I trained a Machine Learning model to predict chaos from initial conditions.

🧠 What’s Inside:
	•	🌌 Physics-inspired data from vector fields
	•	⚙️ Stability labeling using distance thresholds
	•	🌲 Random Forest Classifier (100% accuracy on test set!)
	•	🎨 Force field visualization with quiver plots
	•	🧭 Decision boundary mapping
	•	🔁 Real-time animation (coming next)

⸻

🧪 Technologies:
	•	Python / NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib
	•	scikit-learn
	•	Pure vector calculus + Newtonian physics
